## Abstract


### Ethical Ambivalence of hero Tales and Karma - Comparison of Motif in an Ethical Digital map

 */ Eunseo Choi, Gabeen Yoon*

This study examines how classical and modern heroic narratives deal with the moral ambivalence of the hero. Focusing on the coexistence of virtuous and immoral deeds in a single character's actions in heroic narratives, it examines how such contradictions have been justified and accepted by people in different cultures and eras. This analysis is conducted through the Jeju Mugain Chasabonpul, Segyeongbonpul, Munjeonbonpul, and Yigongbonpul, along with several human heroes, including Achilles and Odysseus from Homer's epic poems, the Iliad and Odyssey, as primary examples.
The study also looks at modern-day heroes, including heroic characters from Marvel and DC Comics, such as Iron Man and Batman, and heroic characters from Korean movies and dramas. By comparing mythical and modern heroes with moral ambivalence—morally noble sacrifice and morally ambiguous behavior—this study explores the differences between past and present approaches to heroic narratives. Whereas past narratives addressed divine intervention or karmic retribution to justify the immoral acts of the idealized hero—acts such as genocide and parricide—today's heroic narratives use the hero's inherent and all-too-human flaws as a means to create an unstable heroic archetype or finished heroic narrative.
By analyzing the motifs that appear in each heroic narrative, this study aims to create a digital motif map that allows us to visually see the similarities between the motifs and to predict how the production and reception of heroic narratives have changed over time and where they may ultimately be headed.
